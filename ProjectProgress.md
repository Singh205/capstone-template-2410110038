doc_processing:This code sets up a complete workflow for loading, splitting, and embedding documents so they can be searched semantically. It loads PDF or text files, breaks them into manageable chunks, and stores their embeddings in a Chroma vector database. A sample contract is processed to test everything, and then semantic queries like payment terms or termination conditions are run against the vector store. Overall, it verifies that the document-processing pipeline works end-to-end.
